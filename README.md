Importan Note: 
Inorder to run the code, please place the testImplementation file in the NdLinear folder and it will run properly.

Description: 
Efficient Self-Supervised Representation Learning with NdLinear Projection Heads, this project aims to untilize self supervised learning model but tries to make it efficient using
Ndlinear layer model and compares it with a baseline model. We use CNN(ResNet18) as our encoder and use two Projection Heads (one based on baseline model and one based on the NdLinear Layer architecture)
We use NTXtent Loss to measure the accuracy and loss of each model and determine the efficiency and effectiveness of each model. 

Results Interpretation: 
So, the result after  5 epochs of training for Baseline Model and NdLinear layer model shows that the NdLinear layer model has slightly lesser loss as compared to the Baseline Model. 
Which can also be further improved by tweaking the number of layers used and dimensions and features. But it establishes one thing that NdLinear Layer model in this instance performed slightly
better than the baseline model and it trained faster too and with right adjustments it can has greater loss difference as well.

The purpose of this project is to submit a project that showcases my ability to work with PyTorch deep learning frame work and my ability to integrate NdLinear into existing models
This is a submission for the internship opportunity provided by the ensemble AI. 
Moreover, this project helped me in improving my PyTorch skills and gave me an in depth understanding of NdLayers model. 
I hope you will consider my application and I will be happy to understand more and work more on this with Ensemble AI
Thank You Very Much!



The screenshots provide three test runs of the code and along with the outputs and finally I provided with train loss curves and train time curves.
